# Problem Statement
- Our goal is to create furniture that will appeal to those who want to keep in touch with their rustic past while blending it with the current times of modern furniture.

# Purpose of the site
- We wanted out site to have a clean simplistic feel to it. Each link takes you into the room you are looking for, whether it's a bathroom to a lounge. We have it all at Booming Comforts.

# Audience
- We wanted the audience of our site to be anyone who had a unique feel for industrial furniture. However it is mostly targeted towards elderly wealthy gentlemen who want to spruce up their homes.

# Competitor Analysis

## www.worldmarket.com
- World Market: Has everything your eyes really needs to see at first glance and the shop is another simplistic looking site for the sake of the demographic looking for simple looking furniture. Variety is another part of the storefront and the site is easy to navigate. Prices are in the 100â€™s but there are deals going on to sweeten the deals offered.

## www.allmodern.com
-AllModern: Shop site is confined, simplistic, easy on the eyes. Prices are in the high hundreds yet the offerings are numerous and well made. Site is meant for adults and not much else due to how the site is structured.


# What's Next
- As we grow, we will add more furniture and draw in a greater audience through hard work and perseverance!
