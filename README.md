# Problem Statement
- Our goal is to create furniture that will appeal to those who want to keep in touch with their rustic past while blending it with the current times of modern furniture.

# Purpose of the site
- The purpose of “Booming Comforts” is to not just provide the highest quality industrial and modern furniture to our customers, but to show them the hospitality we would treat our own family with. We don’t just want to sell furniture, we sell an entire experience. By having a lounge in our local store we provide a one of a kind experience for customers to enjoy, where we will offer them a taste of our furniture with our luxurious lounge chairs with complementary bourbon and cigars where they can converse with our other customers. Our prices our high because of the services we offer, a warm welcome and a warranty to last a lifetime, as we will do anything we can to ensure our customers satisfaction and ensure that their furniture is to their standards. Our site separates all of our furniture into separate categories for easy access so a customer can find what they are looking for without the hassle of having to search the entire site. We have a page dedicated solely to our lounge so our customers know the experience they would get by spending time with us and coming into the store rather than just purchasing online. Our homepage gives our customers a basic view of what we can do for an entire room, showing off some of our finer furniture in a full setting. We want our customers to have a comfortable experience both with our site and our business, and that is the goal of having a site that is very consistent in its layout and design.

# Audience
- “Booming Comforts” is not a store for your average joe, we have a high price point due to the quality of our furniture and the services we provide. We design and create furniture for this in the top percentile of earners around us, providing luxury to those who desire it. Our products are of the highest quality and they are meant for those who have largely succeeded in business and want to show off what their hard work has earned them. These are typically older white men which is why bourbon and cigars are offered in our lounge as they typically appeal to those from the generation of “Baby Boomers”. If you have the money then we will appeal to you as there is no brand that can compete with our quality of products and the experience you would receive with our outstanding customer service.

# Competitor Analysis

## www.worldmarket.com
- World Market: Has everything your eyes really needs to see at first glance and the shop is another simplistic looking site for the sake of the demographic looking for simple looking furniture. Variety is another part of the storefront and the site is easy to navigate. Prices are in the 100’s but there are deals going on to sweeten their offers.

## www.allmodern.com
-Shop site is confined, simplistic, easy on the eyes. Prices are in the high hundreds yet the offerings are numerous and well made. Site is meant for adults and not much else due to how the site is structured.

## www.industrialhome.com
- Not a very flashy site, which is good it doesn’t show too much that it is distracting to a customer. The site has a similar navigation bar as ours but has a drop down menu to choose from for each option in the bar, a very nice and clean addition that makes the site easy to navigate. Higher end site such as ours, would probably be our greatest competitor


## Usability Testing
- The usability testing left us with valuable information on how to improve our site for customers preferences. One thing that was presented by multiple users was that our homepage appeared to be cramped, and despite us liking the layout we switched it to something more convenient and easier on customers eyes so it would be easier to understand what our site was about and what we were selling. On the separate pages for all of our products we also realised the layout of our products was not the most efficient so that was changed to make the space be used to its fullest potential. One of the most important things that we changed however was the descriptions and prices of our products. At first we were going for the approach that we would not display prices as some high end companies do so a customer would not know what they are paying until checkout. This was obviously not a great approach, and one of our users told us that we should have our descriptions of the products be more obvious and closer to our product images so the customer would know which image our description was describing as it was not clear enough before. All in all the usability testing went well as most of the users seemed to like the direction we were taking our site and said it appeared to be professional and that what we were going for was depicted very well.



# What's Next
- At the moment the future of “Booming Comforts” is uncertain but what can be said is that it’s creators are proud of it. We do not want to see our site and business fall apart and be unused but it would be a difficult task to keep the business running without enough income being brought in from our sales. After the hard work we have all put into the site we want to see people enjoy what we’ve created, as that’s what our project was all about. It wasn’t just about selling our furniture, but selling the idea that there are ways to improve someone’s overall experience in anything, even the sale of furniture. Taking a personal and welcoming approach over the typical “very professional and to the point” approach separates us from the competition and makes us a more appealing option than somewhere that sells an item to you without caring about what happens to their customers in the future. We want our approach to live on and for people to recognize that there’s more to sales than just the sale itself, and that is what how we want “Booming Comforts” to live on.
